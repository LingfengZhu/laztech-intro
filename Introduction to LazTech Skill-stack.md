# Introduction to LazTech Skill-stack

`@Author: Junda Chen (Mike)`

Welcome to Laztech, a dynamically developing astrophysics group led by **Full Professor Alex Lazarian** in University of Wisconsin - Madison.

The **Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT)** is a prospective technique to __map the magnetic field of the universe__ with less cost and higher accuracy.

Don't worry. No one's gonna test you about astrophysics or VGT, nor should you think that having Physics/CS/Statistics background alone can achieve great things on your own. The thing is this: you might need to understand each of them for a little bit, and learn the rest iteratively and cooperatively with our nice yet highly efficient and demanding team members. You will learn a lot -- not just hard skills, but also how to do science like doing a business.



This is the friendly documents that introduce to you what we're doing and how we do it. You're welcome to selectively read the contents at your own pace.
