# Introduction to LazTech Skill-stack

## Preface (Nothing valuable here)

Welcome to Laztech, a dynamically developing astrophysics group led by **Full Professor Alex Lazarian** in University of Wisconsin - Madison.

The **Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT)** is a prospective technique to __map the magnetic field of the universe__ with less cost and higher accuracy.

Don't worry. No one's gonna test you about astrophysics or VGT, nor should you think that having Physics/CS/Statistics background alone can achieve great things on your own. The thing is this: you might need to understand each of them for a little bit, and learn the rest iteratively and cooperatively with our nice yet highly efficient and demanding team members. You will learn a lot -- not just hard skills, but also how to do science like doing a business.

This is the friendly documents that introduce to you what we're doing and how we do it. You're welcome to selectively read the contents at your own pace. 

## Read from here

1. Read this:[Get Started in LazTech Group](https://www.overleaf.com/9279691msypmpcjnpqp#/33470921/). The essential basics of physics is stated here. Make sure you read this. Here are several questions:
   1. What is 
   2. Can you run the code without error? Why?
   3. What's the code talks about? What's the result?
   4. How long did it take? Can it be improved?

2. Here's the things you need to install/get through: (detail will post later)
  1. Julia (0.6.4, and 1.0.0), Python
    1. Basic Julia syntax. Matrix operation. Install/Call Julia module. Call python module. 
    2. Some libraries in Julia: `HDF5`, ``
    3. Some libraries in Python: `numpy`, `matlibplot`
  2. Github
  3. Anaconda (prefereably 2)
  4.
